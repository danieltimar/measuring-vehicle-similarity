# measuring-vehicle-similarity
This repository contains an application of a tf-idf-based similarity algorithm run on car data.

In case the Jupyter Notebook in the python folder fails to render, please visit this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/danieltimar/measuring-vehicle-similarity/blob/master/python/vehicle_similarity_comparison.ipynb). 

The method applied here was inspired from [here](https://bergvca.github.io/2017/10/14/super-fast-string-matching.html).
